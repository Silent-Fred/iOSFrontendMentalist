# iOSFrontendMentalist
iOS Frontend for the Mentalist project - educational style

## What does _educational style_ mean?
The source is intended to focus on some rather specific topics to be shown
and discussed in class. Whatever distracts from this focus was considered
less important, even though it might be important in another context. For
example, there are no tests included, localisation is missing, error handling 
is fairly rudimental, even some functionality that might make the game
more fun to play is just not implemented. Instead, the focus is on a simple
but clear presentation of the internal decision making process.

In short: the source could be used as a basis for a game, but it is â€“ in its
current state - not intended to be a fully-fledged frontend to the game backend,
which likewise is provided in _educational style_.
